- Secondary market for invoice trading
- Instant liquidity for suppliers through invoice factoring

### Smart Contract Automation
- Automated payment execution upon delivery confirmation
- Multi-signature approval workflows
- Real-time tracking of payment status
- Configurable payment terms and conditions

### Credit Scoring System
- Dynamic credit scoring based on:
    - On-time delivery performance
    - Payment history
    - Transaction volume
    - Network relationships
- Machine learning models for risk assessment
- Transparent scoring criteria

### Banking Integration
- Seamless fiat currency on/off ramps
- Integration with traditional banking APIs
- Support for multiple currencies
- Automated reconciliation

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts
```solidity
// Core smart contracts:

- BankingBridge.sol: Interfaces with traditional banking systems
```

### Tech Stack
- Blockchain: Ethereum/Polygon
- Smart Contracts: Solidity
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Frontend: React, Web3.js
- Database: MongoDB
- Banking Integration: Plaid API
